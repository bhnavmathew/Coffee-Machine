# Coffee-Machine
This is a coffee Machine stimulator using python which I learned from Udemy
The indgredints costs and components required are inputed into a dictionary
The keys of the dictionary are accessed and used in the for loops and the functions 
It uses a while loop with boolean values to turn on/off the Machine and stops when the machine is out of ingreidients or the power is off.
